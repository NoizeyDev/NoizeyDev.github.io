    <br>
    <p class="text-center">Beardy's Valor is my first attempt at a Skyrim modlist. <br> As a long time player, I have always enjoyed the story of the game but have been victim of boredom with its repetitive action.
    <br>The modding community have done an amazing job pulling together and tackling the nuances about this game that grind on the player. And I intend to compliment their work by curating this modlist.
    <br><br>
    What do I want from this modlist? Performance and beauty, but with a heavy focus on animations and mechanics. I want the game to feel as fresh as possible, whilst retaining the magic that the game released with.<br>

    <h2 class="text-center"> MCO | ADXP</h2>
    <br>
    <p class="text-center"> The advancements with moveesets have been impressive over the last few years, and in v1.0 ill be building the entire framework around MCO | ADXP.
    <br>It has been a fascinating project and i feel confident I can curate the collections to suit any play style.</p>

    <h2 class="text-center"> SCAR - OAR - Goetia - Vanguard - Smooth Moveset - SIGMA</h2>
    <br>
    <p class="text-center">This modlist includes both 1st and 3rd person animations.
        <br>The work put out by SIGMA in their 1st person animations has really lifted my gameplay as of late. And as someone who enjoys flipping between 1st and 3rd person, I knew this had to be included.<br>
        Verolevi's work with Goetia, Leviathan and Vanguard has been a staple go to for many modders, expect them in this list.
        <br>I will be creating custom OAR conditionals for this list, and expanding this with SCAR AI and Stances. I have no intention of releasing this list with stock conditions. Expect a new experience with each click
