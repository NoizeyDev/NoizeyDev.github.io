    <h2 id="whatisit" class="text-center">What is Beardy's Valor?</h2>
    <p class="text-center">Beardy's Valor is my first attempt at a Skyrim modlist. As a long term player, I have always enjoyed the story of the game. And almost with equal measure found it to be one of the most frustrating to try and work around.
        What do I want from this modlist? Performant, but beautiful, with a heavy focus on animations and mechanics, but keeping lore as intact as possible.<br>
        MCO | ADXP, SCAR, OAR. Goetia, Vanguard, Smooth Moveset. Both 1st and 3rd person.<br>
        Not on a top end PC? Only interested in Next Gen textures?
        Don't worry, I have you covered. High performance & High Detail profiles available <br>
